### This is the complete documentation on CSS(_Cascading Style Sheet_).
CSS is used to style the web pages created by html.

There are three ways to attach css in a html file.

> 1. Inline CSS = It is written inside of a html tag - for example 
        <hr style="width:50px; color:limegreen;"> 
    Inline css is considered as bad coding.

> 2. Internal CSS = It is written inside the head tag of html - for example 
        <head>
            <style>
                p{color:red;}
            </style>
        </head>

> 3. External CSS = It is considered as best practice to style html code. It uses an external file with a .css extension and it can be linked inside head of a html document by using 
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="address of the .css file">
